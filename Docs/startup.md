# KubeWise Startup Architecture

## Initialization Model

KubeWise implements a structured initialization sequence focused on graceful service startup, dependency verification, and visual feedback. The startup process is designed to ensure all components are properly initialized before accepting traffic.

### Core Startup Phases

1. **Application Bootstrap**
   * Server core initialization with configuration validation
   * Environment variable loading and validation
   * Dynamic banner rendering with system information

2. **External Dependency Connection**
   * Asynchronous connection establishment to MongoDB Atlas
   * Kubernetes cluster authentication and API client initialization
   * Prometheus endpoint verification
   * Circuit breaker initialization for all external services

3. **Component Initialization**
   * Queue creation with appropriate capacity settings
   * Background task spawning with proper error handling
   * Model initialization including River ML anomaly detectors
   * Pydantic-AI agent configuration with Gemini model

4. **Health Registration**
   * Health check endpoint registration
   * Service readiness indicator setup
   * Dependency status tracking initialization
   * Last successful operation timestamp initialization

### Startup Visualization

The startup sequence features a rich visual experience through the `rich` library:

* Progressive loading indicators for each initialization phase
* Color-coded status indicators for successful connections
* Detailed cluster information display upon successful connection
* Graceful error presentation with recovery suggestions

### Fault Tolerance

The initialization sequence implements robust fault handling:

* Exponential backoff for transient dependency failures
* Descriptive error messages with troubleshooting guidance
* Partial startup capability when non-critical components fail
* Kubernetes-compatible readiness signaling

### Startup Performance

The startup architecture optimizes for rapid initialization:

* Parallel initialization of independent components
* Lazy loading of non-critical components
* Minimal blocking operations in the critical path
* Progressive resource acquisition

## Startup Integration

The startup process integrates with the broader KubeWise architecture through:

* Dependency injection of initialized components
* FastAPI lifespan management for resource lifecycle
* Graceful shutdown hooks registration
* Health check status reflection

This architecture ensures KubeWise starts reliably with proper dependency verification while providing clear feedback on the initialization state.
